# Pseint_Learning_logic

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and programs developed in PSeInt, a software tool for learning to program using pseudocode.

## Description

This project aims to teach the fundamentals of programming by using pseudocode in PSeInt. It contains different exercises, solved problems and examples covering topics such as:

- **Control structures**
- **Loops**
- **Conditionals**
- **Functions**
- **Arrays and matrices**
- **String handling**

##  Requirements

PSeInt must be installed to run the algorithms. You can download it from the official site.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuanJRP/Pseint_Learning_Logic.git

2. Open the .psc files in PSeInt.

3. Usage
    To run a file, follow these steps:

    - **Open PSeInt.**
    - **Go to File > Open and select the pseudocode (.psc) file you want to run.**
    - **Click Run > Run Program or press F9 to see the result.**
